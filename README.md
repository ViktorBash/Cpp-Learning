# Environment Setup
- Use Clion
- Get the "C/C++ Single File Execution" plugin
    - Instead of manually adding ```add_executable(Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
      "Learning C++/tutorial.cpp")``` to CMakeLists.txt, you can do it with one click now.
- Project is sorted into different folders for different topics, and sometimes multiple files within each folder
